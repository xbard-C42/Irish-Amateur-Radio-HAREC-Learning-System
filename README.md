## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a local copy of the project up and running.

### Prerequisites

*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or newer recommended)
*   [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (or your preferred package manager like yarn, pnpm)
*   A Google Gemini API Key. You can get one from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/irish-amateur-radio-harec-learning-system.git
    cd irish-amateur-radio-harec-learning-system
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a file named `.env` in the root of the project and add your Gemini API key:
    ```.env
    GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
    ```
    The Vite configuration (`vite.config.ts`) is already set up to load this variable.

### Available Scripts

*   **Run the development server:**
    Starts the app in development mode with hot-reloading.
    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```
    Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) (or the port specified in your terminal) to view it in your browser.

*   **Build for production:**
    Bundles the app for production to the `dist` folder.
    ```sh
    npm run build
    ```

*   **Preview the production build:**
    Serves the `dist` folder to preview the production build locally.
    ```sh
    npm run preview
    ```

## ü§ñ AI Study Buddy Integration

The application integrates the Google Gemini API to provide an intelligent chat assistant.

*   The chat session is initialized with a system prompt that gives the AI its persona ("EI-AI," an expert tutor for the Irish HAREC exam).
*   When a user opens the chat from a specific topic page, the content of that topic is added to the AI's context. This allows for highly relevant, context-aware answers.
*   The chat history is managed within the React state, providing a seamless conversational experience.
